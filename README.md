# The Pig Game

## Overview

The Pig Game is a chance game played with dice. The object is to reach a certain goal (typically 100) faster than your opponent. Alternately, the game can be played alone where the object is to reach a high score in a given set of turns.

## Program structure

The program is divided into two files. The first, *solitaire.py*, houses the main function and the game logic that plays the game. The second, *player.py*, stores the different AI programs that run in the main file.

## How to use

The program runs from the command line and prints results there as well. There are options for setting the computer strategy, number of turns and also an interval to run the game over. These options are all commented out to speed up the process of running simulations.

## Jupyter

While the game can be made to run from the command line, the game is currently also built in a Jupyter Notebook file, to quickly create graphs that demonstrate the performance of various computer strategies. There are also saved a collection of graphs showing runs of the computer strategies.
